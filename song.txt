Boom, boom boom
It's show time, motherfucker, it's on
Apocalypse now, I'm dropping this bomb
You can't fuck with this song
I stick to this spliff I'm not clampin this bong
I'm a wild child, I don't wanna go to bed
Uh shit sorry man I'm stoned again
Aooooh and now everything's getting so psychedelic
When I'm doos dronk and forget all my fuckin lyrics
Like umm ah who gives a fuck?
Don't worry bout it just blow a kiss to me
